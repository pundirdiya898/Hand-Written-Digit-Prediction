# Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify handwritten digits (0 through 9) based on image input. Using the well-known MNIST dataset, the system learns patterns in pixel values to accurately predict the digit shown in grayscale 28x28 images.
